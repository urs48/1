	The concept revolves around the beginning of a digital/electronic shut down in Yelahanka due to radiating fumes emitted from cow dung patty that are splattered on the streets. The hidden story-line behind this concept would be that an old man experiments with the fodder fed to cattle with the intention of eliminating modern technology from the area. The superstitious residents blame the events on a neglected goddess. Curious students/investigators begin researching these unusual events.
